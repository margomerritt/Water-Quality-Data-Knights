1. Night One 2/27/23

  Tonight we decided on a topic, and narrowed down our data choices to two sources. We have decided on a plan to use multiple items from our courses in order to display data of water quality based on demographics and geographic location. Some of that data that we would like to use in order to convey the most important information are going to be percenctages of demographics, average salary, geographic location. We would like to incorporate a way to display local government funding on infastructure and annual budget for public services and water purifying plants, as well as total number of purification stations in each geographic location using zipcodes. We plan to use these findings in order to create multiple visualizations that will make it easily understandable to our audience to determine the water quality of their chosen location.
